What new features are you using now, either in production or otherwise?   The second part is a follow-up, concerning the new standard once it is final:   Do you expect to use it immediately?  What are you doing to prepare for C++11, other than as listed for the previous questions? Obviously, compiler support must be there, but there's still co-workers, ancillary tools, and other factors to consider.  What will most affect your adoption?     Edit: The original really was too argumentative; however, I'm still interested in the underlying question, so I've tried to clean it up and hopefully make it acceptable.  This seems a much better avenue than duplicating&mdash;even though some answers responded to the argumentative tone, they still apply to the extent that they addressed the questions, and all answers are community property to be cleaned up as appropriate, too. \n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Improved Code Safety**: Migrating from C++11 to C++13 or higher versions ensures compliance with updated standards, which can lead to improved code safety through reduced risks of undefined behavior.\n",
      "2. **Enhanced Performance**: New features in C++13 and later (like `std::atomic` for better thread-safety) and the latest standard (`C++20` with concepts, ranges, and coroutines) provide opportunities for performance improvements in modern applications.\n",
      "3. **Future-Proofing Code**: Adopting newer standards means your code is more likely to remain relevant as time passes, without needing significant updates to take advantage of future features.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenges:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Compiler Support**: Early adoption might require using beta or experimental compilers, which can introduce bugs and compatibility issues.\n",
      "2. **Portability Issues**: As you migrate forward in standards, older codebases may need adjustments for the newer versions' requirements, potentially complicating cross-platform development.\n",
      "3. **Code Review and Testing**: Thoroughly reviewing and testing your updated codebase is crucial to ensure that changes align with intended outcomes without introducing new bugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Best Practices for Source Code Rejuvenation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incremental Changes**: Update code incrementally rather than all at once, starting with parts of the codebase where newer features can provide significant benefits.\n",
      "2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Use TDD methodologies to ensure that changes do not introduce regressions and align with expected outcomes before merging them into your main branch.\n",
      "3. **Code Review and Pair Programming**: Engage in regular code reviews, especially when adopting new features or updating older code, to catch any mistakes early and improve collective understanding of the updated codebase.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for migrating from C++11 to C++13 specifically, given that there isn't a significant gap between these versions like the one from C++11 to C++20, benefits primarily revolve around taking advantage of newer features aimed at improving safety (`std::atomic`) and performance without needing a major jump in standards. The challenges and best practices mentioned above remain relevant for such migrations, focusing on ensuring smooth adoption with minimal disruptions.\n"
